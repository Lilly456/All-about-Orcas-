    <h2 style="color:powderblue;"> Did you know that Orcas are picky eaters and as soon as they figure out what there families like to eat they most likely donâ€™t switch their diets.
       They mostly feed on fish, seals and sea lions, dolphins and porpoises, sharks and rays, large whales, seabirds and much more.
       However some orcas hunt on specific prey.</h2>
