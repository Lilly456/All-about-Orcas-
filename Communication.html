<p style="color:powderblue;">Orcas are very social animals They are able to communicate and coordinate hunting strategies. â€œIn orca populations knowledge is passed down from older to younger". Things like What to eat, how and where to find food, how to catch your prey, and which dangerous creatures or things to avoid. Did you know that each orca pod has a unique language.  Each orca group is genetically different when it comes to appearance and cultures. This is due to Orcas eating different things to avoid competing for the same food.</p>
